# PrimeSense

PrimeSense is a Python project that offers powerful functionalities to find prime numbers within a specified range using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. This project includes features to calculate prime statistics, such as the count of primes and the last three prime numbers in a given range.

## Features

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes Algorithm**: Efficiently calculates all prime numbers up to a given `n`.
- **Range-based Prime Finder**: Finds all prime numbers within a specified range `[start, end]`.
- **Prime Statistics**: Provides the count of prime numbers and the last three prime numbers in the specified range.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures user inputs for range are valid and handles errors gracefully.

## Functions

### `sieve_of_eratosthenes(n)`

Returns a list of prime numbers up to `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

### `find_primes_in_range(start, end)`

Finds all prime numbers in the range `[start, end]`.

### `prime_statistics(start, end)`

Provides the last three prime numbers and the count of prime numbers in the range `[start, end]`.

### `get_user_input()`

Prompts the user to enter the start and end of the range, with validation.

### `display_results(start, end, last_three_primes, count_of_primes)`

Displays the results of the prime number calculations.

## Usage

To use PrimeSense, simply execute the `main()` function which prompts for user input and then displays the calculated prime statistics.

```bash
python primesense.py
```
